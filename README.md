Chug
---

Chug is a very simple static web development tool made to replace [Hammer](http://hammerformac.com/). It's not quite ready for primetime.

**Todos:**
* Automatic image compression and spriting
* Better handling for moving non-compiling assets to `build/`
* Linting, maybe?
* Include our defaults: Bourbon, reset, etc.
* Oh, dude: [KSS](https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node)
* Commission a logo featuring an image of [Rupert](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mulegirl/10352944543/in/photostream/)
